          <h2>Culture clash, May 2024</h2>
          <p> When I first heard what the theme of this month's storyslams was going to be, I thought of the classic adventure tales of young adults flinging themselves to a tropical Southeast Asian country and backpacking to find themselves. Although I sorely wish I had the wisdom to do something similar when I was 18 instead of diving off the deep end at an engineering university, I also thought back to what my first feeling of culture clash was. And for me, it was that feeling when you leave your family bubble and become more exposed to the "outside" world, and you realize your family's not as normal as you thought...</p>

          <h2>Against All Odds, November 2024</h2>
          <p>I was so nervous for this one, because for the first time, my close friends were in the audience. It's so much easier to be naked and vulnerable in front of strangers than my own friends, who might add this to their compiled image of me, and think of this every time they see me from now onward. But at the same time, it felt wonderful to be seen by them, and to feel a little bit more understood by them.  </p>

          <h2>Why not?, April 2024</h2>
          <p>My first storyslam, ever! I had recently read The Moth's short story collection, and wondered if ZÃ¼rich had its own storyteller group. Well, it did! And I showed up one rainy April evening without a clue as to how many people would be there and what kind of topics are usually discussed. And after the intermission break, I decided, why not, let's put my name in that hat!</p>
